                            <blockquote></blockquote>
<p>Social media provided a platform which people can share and post anything related to their daily lives. In 2020, there are over 3.6 billion people who are using social media (Tankovska, 2021) and the number are still increasing with the development of our society. At the same time, more and more employers and human resources mangers start to use the social media to trace the candidates and their employees. According to a survey, 60% percent of the employers uses social media to trace their potential candidates and employees. (‚ÄúNumber of Employers Using Social Media to Screen Candidates Has Increased 500 Percent over the Last Decade‚Äù,2016) Also, many employees are fired because of certain post they spread on the social media. However, should the employers have the right to monitor their employees' or potential employee‚Äôs social media and make decisions? The three primary groups who concerned about this problem are the current/potential employees and employer. As many employers are tracing the social media and supporting the usage of surveillance on social media, many employees argued that this behavior invaded their privacy and also leads to some personal bias that unrelated to the working abilities. From my perspective, it is necessary and important to trace their digital actions for several reasons: allowing employer to trace the social media helps to protect the profits of the company and social media serves a great role in selecting the candidates.</p>
<p>To begin with, monitoring employee‚Äôs social media helps to protect the overall benefits of the company. In the workplace, majority of workers are being affected by heavy work tasks, high intensity working environment, and increasing work pressure. Under that circumstances, many workers choose to express their emotions and dissatisfaction with work on social platforms. These posts and some mis-behavior on the Internet will influence the company ‚Äòs reputation directly. Moreover, lots of employees post something that should not be posted online. Contents such as product information, proprietary information, company information or other sensitive data may be unintentionally or intentionally leaked through social media channels. Sometimes, these post on the social media will lead to some legal actions which cost lots of time and effort of a company. Here is an example. In the case of Tianmai Juyan Education Co., Ltd. v. Ma, which is a labor dispute, (‚ÄúTianmai Juyuan (Beijing) Education Technology Co., Ltd. and Ma Wei‚Äôs first-instance civil judgment‚Äù, 2018) Ma was angry because of the company‚Äôs action of salary reduction. Thus, he posted a screenshot of the company‚Äôs private incentive plan and the company‚Äôs internal salary reduction notice in a Chinese social media called WeChat. The Second Intermediate People's Court of Beijing proposes that after Ma posted information related to the company's internal affairs to WeChat, people around him saw the post and left some comments within the social media. As a result, his behavior caused the dissemination and leakage of the company's internal business information. Regardless of whether the information posted is a trade secret of the company, Ma, as an employee, should not arbitrarily post company internal information to social media due to his personal unsatisfaction.  His behavior obviously violates the employee's duty of loyalty and is an excessive expression of wage reduction. The social media contains huge quantity of people, and one post could be spread soon to tremendous amount of people and ruined a company. The monitoring of employee‚Äôs social media like Facebook or Instagram can help the company to find and solve some potential problems quicky. Also, according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), all work-related content posted by employees on social media must be visible, regardless of whether the content is created through a personal account. Therefore, the company could reach out and deal some inappropriate post as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that social media is a great tool for the human resources manager to select the candidates besides the resume they provided. From the resume, the employer can see your abilities and official grades while the personal profile just indicated your personality. Through the research of more than five hundred college students and their Facebook homepages, (knowledgeatwharton,2012) the researchers found the college students‚Äô &quot;Facebook&quot; personal homepage displayed the so-called &quot;Five Personality Traits&quot;:Easy-going, Consciousness, Extroversion, Emotional Stability and Openness. After communicating with the employers of some of these students, the researchers found out that the students' working performance is closely related to the two personality traits: emotional stability and easygoing. Combing the resume and social media can help to draw a real personal profile of a potential candidate. And the top three social media that the most employers are likely to check are: LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. (‚ÄúSocial media Screenings gain in popularity, 2020‚Äù) Besides personality, it is also important to check the candidates‚Äô online persona to make sure they provided a positive image. For example, they will filter out some candidates with misbehavior: some people lie about their qualification, some posts linked to criminal actions, and discriminative speech against other people. Since misbehaviors would cause serious consequences in the future and lead to more troubles. Meanwhile, even seemingly innocuous details and behaviors, such as using unprofessional terms or publishing too frequently, can also help to judge the drawbacks of the candidates. Moreover, through the combination of algorithms and social media, employers can determine whether the candidate has a strong interest in their company and position. For example, if an applicant browses the company's official website records frequently, looks at position-related articles, or pays attention to the development of the company, the applicants will leave a better impression to the employer. Finally, social media can be a good monitoring station for psychological risks. The employers are able to extract and analyze psychological risks of one candidate from the database of emotional catharsis.</p>
<p>For the positive position, there are also some counterclaims that argue against it. One opinion suggested that the company rejects qualified job applicants just because they do not like what they find online. To be more specific, some manger will choose the candidate based on their own preference. Some candidates might lose their just because their race, sexual orientation, or some wrong post they made. Many people thought it is an unfair selection and the surveillance of social media should stop. Also, by looking at the social media webpage of a person, it is easy to form a stereotype of a person while the fact is not like that. For example, if a person posted a picture of drinking, that normally leave bad first impression to the employer. Some employers will subjectively believe that the competitor likes to drink and form the stereotypes of this person. The employers might make the decision of rejection just because he or she thought drink might affect the work in the future. However, the fact would be this competitor just drank alcohol due to a bad mood and did not have the habit of drinking regularly. The way of using social media to measure a person is unfair and also leading to some issues. Thus, employers should not trace the candidates‚Äô personal social media. For this point, I want to make a rebuttal. The behavior of rejecting people just because they post the thing the employer did not like will also influence and bring harmful consequences to the employer‚Äôs career. The main mission for the employer is to find a person that really fit certain position and meet the core value of the companies. To find the right candidate, the employer needs to use more comprehensive of measurements (‚ÄúHow to hire the right person‚Äù) according to the New York Times. Employers simply use social media as an auxiliary tool to measure competitors. A professionally qualified employer will make an opinion based on the competitor's comprehensive ability and whether he or she is competent for certain specific position. Making decisions based solely on the content of social media is sloppy, and this action will cause the company to lose some potential talent so many employers will not do that. Another aspect we cannot overlook is that social media is still a great tool to reflect the characters of competitors, (Seidman, 2020) and we cannot ignore the importance of this tool. When employees are deciding on two competitors with the same ability, personality may become the main factor determining who will enter the company. In addition, employers are aware of potential legal and regulatory risks. If the hire manager learn that an applicant is a homosexual or other disadvantaged group and hire someone else just because they saw that information on the social media, the manager may face discrimination prosecution. Employers will not take huge risks to make decisions based solely on their personal preferences for social media. As a result, social media can be used as an objective and rational tool to measure the competence of competitors.</p>
<p>In general, this problem is still very controversial and involved with many ethnical and technological issues. From all the points that I listed above, I agree with the point that employers should be allowed to surveil their employees' or potential employee‚Äôs digital actions and made decisions.</p>
