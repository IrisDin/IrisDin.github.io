<p>‚ÄÉ My decision to study informatics derives from my ambition to serve human beings through technology, but coming to that decision was a process of exploration. I was first exposed to contents related to informatics in My senior year in high school. In the beginning of Covid-19 in 2020, all of us was panic due to lack of information about the virus. I searched all news and media to put the pieces together and caught the sight of whole puzzle. That was when I realized the importance of information. An efficient information system could help me turn information into actionable knowledge. Therefore, I have a strong intent to develop solutions to the world's information challenges for myself and the communities. This is my first love into informatics.</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ After that, in the university, I have a deeper understanding of informatics. As a member of Chinese students who account for the vast majority of American international students, I‚Äôm much better able to realize that international students are facing many serious social, physical and spiritual problems. Especially during the pandemic period, many students can only take online classes, so time equation, lacking of communication with teachers and other questions cause emotional problems and academic pressure. In communicating with classmates, I found that many are under this kind of pressure silently, some even suspend or drop out, including myself. Furthermore, I found that not only Chinese students, but students from other countries also face the same psychological problems. Thus, I had the idea of designing an app to help solve the psychological problems of students. I would like to design a platform to help this special group in our community. By using machine learning methods, I could collect dataÔºåprovide them information from the school, different solutions for their concerns and match different friends or mentors to help them. So here comes Mental Bridge. Our team for Info200 build the simple framework of the app together. But that was not enough, I would like to make the platform and help our international community in real world.</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ Through three semesters' university life, I am more determined in learning informatics. The past learning experience has given me enough confidence and ability to deal with future tasks. I took a glimpse of the whole information world though Info200. I learned fundamental skills of manipulating data, machine learning and making simple regression in Info180. By using right ways to analyze data through the models in this world which has tons of information, I could push right news and right people to help my Mental Bridge users.</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ Therefore, interest and reality motivated me to make the determination to study informatics. In my opinion, diversified courses in major informatics will make me be able to learn foundational skills and practical technology in information technology, also provide me with an interdisciplinary perspective to close the gap between technology and human needs by translating users‚Äô requirements into technological solutions. The course Data Reasoning in a Digital World can teach me analyze the authenticity of information sources, on the basis of true information. The course Foundational Skills for Data Science can teach me how to analyze and use data through programming. While Databases and Data Modeling introduces the relevant knowledge of the database system, and links data modeling decisions to social justice outcomes. What‚Äôs more, my serious learning attitude and hardworking spirit will also help me to my future study of informatics.</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ I believe that after learning more knowledge, I can continuously optimize and develop Mental Bridge, so that it can collect students‚Äô psychological problems and provide suitable solutions. In other words, I want to finally create a bridge connecting students and counselors to solve the current situation when seeking help. And through my study in Informatics, I could make the program more accurate and eliminate the bias of misunderstanding users' needs in the progress of matching right solutions for every single student who needs help not only Chinese students.</p>
<p>‚ÄÉ We are living in a era of major technological advances and information exploration. I will dedicate myself in studying how to use these information to improve our lives and make our community better. Through informatics major, I will explore the methods of change our community or even our world.</p>
