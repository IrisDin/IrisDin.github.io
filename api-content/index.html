In 2020, there are over 3.6 billion people who are using social media (Tankovska, 2021) and the number are still increasing with the development of our society. At the same time, more and more employers and human resources mangers start to use the social media to trace the candidates and their employees. According to a survey, 60% percent of the employers uses social media to trace their potential candidates and employees. (“Number of Employers Using Social Media to Screen Candidates Has Increased 500 Percent over the Last Decade”,2016) Also, many employees are fired because of certain post they spread on the social media. However, should the employers have the right to monitor their employees' or potential employee’s social media and make decisions? The three primary groups who concerned about this problem are the current/potential employees and employer. As many employers are tracing the social media and supporting the usage of surveillance on social media, many employees argued that this behavior invaded their privacy and also leads to some personal bias that unrelated to the working abilities. From my perspective, it is necessary and important to trace their digital actions for several reasons: allowing employer to trace the social media helps to protect the profits of the company and social media serves a great role in selecting the candidates. To begin with, monitoring employee’s social media helps to protect the overall benefits of the company. In the workplace, majority of workers are being affected by heavy work tasks, high intensity working environment, and increasing work pressure. Under that circumstances, many workers choose to express their emotions and dissatisfaction with work on social platforms. These posts and some mis-behavior on the Internet will influence the company ‘s reputation directly. Moreover, lots of employees post something that should not be posted online. Contents such as product information, proprietary information, company information or other sensitive data may be unintentionally or intentionally leaked through social media channels. Sometimes, these post on the social media will lead to some legal actions which cost lots of time and effort of a company. Here is an example. In the case of Tianmai Juyan Education Co., Ltd. v. Ma, which is a labor dispute, (“Tianmai Juyuan (Beijing) Education Technology Co., Ltd. and Ma Wei’s first-instance civil judgment”, 2018) Ma was angry because of the company’s action of salary reduction. Thus, he posted a screenshot of the company’s private incentive plan and the company’s internal salary reduction notice in a Chinese social media called WeChat. The Second Intermediate People's Court of Beijing proposes that after Ma posted information related to the company's internal affairs to WeChat, people around him saw the post and left some comments within the social media. As a result, his behavior caused the dissemination and leakage of the company's internal business information. Regardless of whether the information posted is a trade secret of the company, Ma, as an employee, should not arbitrarily post company internal information to social media due to his personal unsatisfaction. His behavior obviously violates the employee's duty of loyalty and is an excessive expression of wage reduction. The social media contains huge quantity of people, and one post could be spread soon to tremendous amount of people and ruined a company. The monitoring of employee’s social media like Facebook or Instagram can help the company to find and solve some potential problems quicky. Also, according to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), all work-related content posted by employees on social media must be visible, regardless of whether the content is created through a personal account. Therefore, the company could reach out and deal some inappropriate post as soon as possible. Another aspect is that social media is a great tool for the human resources manager to select the candidates besides the resume they provided. From the resume, the employer can see your abilities and official grades while the personal profile just indicated your personality. Through the research of more than five hundred college students and their Facebook homepages, (knowledgeatwharton,2012) the researchers found the college students’ &quot;Facebook&quot; personal homepage displayed the so-called &quot;Five Personality Traits&quot;:Easy-going, Consciousness, Extroversion, Emotional Stability and Openness. After communicating with the employers of some of these students, the researchers found out that the students' working performance is closely related to the two personality traits: emotional stability and easygoing. Combing the resume and social media can help to draw a real personal profile of a potential candidate. And the top three social media that the most employers are likely to check are: LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter. (“Social media Screenings gain in popularity, 2020”) Besides personality, it is also important to check the candidates’ online persona to make sure they provided a positive image. For example, they will filter out some candidates with misbehavior: some people lie about their qualification, some posts linked to criminal actions, and discriminative speech against other people. Since misbehaviors would cause serious consequences in the future and lead to more troubles. Meanwhile, even seemingly innocuous details and behaviors, such as using unprofessional terms or publishing too frequently, can also help to judge the drawbacks of the candidates. Moreover, through the combination of algorithms and social media, employers can determine whether the candidate has a strong interest in their company and position. For example, if an applicant browses the company's official website records frequently, looks at position-related articles, or pays attention to the development of the company, the applicants will leave a better impression to the employer. Finally, social media can be a good monitoring station for psychological risks. The employers are able to extract and analyze psychological risks of one candidate from the database of emotional catharsis. For the positive position, there are also some counterclaims that argue against it. One opinion suggested that the company rejects qualified job applicants just because they do not like what they find online. To be more specific, some manger will choose the candidate based on their own preference. Some candidates might lose their just because their race, sexual orientation, or some wrong post they made. Many people thought it is an unfair selection and the surveillance of social media should stop. Also, by looking at the social media webpage of a person, it is easy to form a stereotype of a person while the fact is not like that. For example, if a person posted a picture of drinking, that normally leave bad first impression to the employer. Some employers will subjectively believe that the competitor likes to drink and form the stereotypes of this person. The employers might make the decision of rejection just because he or she thought drink might affect the work in the future. However, the fact would be this competitor just drank alcohol due to a bad mood and did not have the habit of drinking regularly. The way of using social media to measure a person is unfair and also leading to some issues. Thus, employers should not trace the candidates’ personal social media. For this point, I want to make a rebuttal. The behavior of rejecting people just because they post the thing the employer did not like will also influence and bring harmful consequences to the employer’s career. The main mission for the employer is to find a person that really fit certain position and meet the core value of the companies. To find the right candidate, the employer needs to use more comprehensive of measurements (“How to hire the right person”) according to the New York Times. Employers simply use social media as an auxiliary tool to measure competitors. A professionally qualified employer will make an opinion based on the competitor's comprehensive ability and whether he or she is competent for certain specific position. Making decisions based solely on the content of social media is sloppy, and this action will cause the company to lose some potential talent so many employers will not do that. Another aspect we cannot overlook is that social media is still a great tool to reflect the characters of competitors, (Seidman, 2020) and we cannot ignore the importance of this tool. When employees are deciding on two competitors with the same ability, personality may become the main factor determining who will enter the company. In addition, employers are aware of potential legal and regulatory risks. If the hire manager learn that an applicant is a homosexual or other disadvantaged group and hire someone else just because they saw that information on the social media, the manager may face discrimination prosecution. Employers will not take huge risks to make decisions based solely on their personal preferences for social media. As a result, social media can be used as an objective and rational tool to measure the competence of competitors. In general, this problem is still very controversial and involved with many ethnical and technological issues. From all the points that I listed above, I agree with the point that employers should be allowed to surveil their employees' or potential employee’s digital actions and made decisions.

And guests can find the commendations like their own house. A lot of people choose Airbnb since it is normally cheaper than a hotel room and there are lots of options for choosing. People can also earn extra money by renting the house out. The platform gets profits by charging the commission from the costumer’s booking. Currently, people can access Airbnb via its website and mobile app. Stakeholder Research: Direct Stakeholders: The people who booked their house would be the direct stakeholder group for this design. In definition, stakeholders are people who have an interest in the company’s affairs. The tenant wants to find a comfortable place to stay or for other purposes. As a result, this group would be the direct stakeholder. In order to make analysis deeply, I used the research method like surveys and review of online discuss. I choose to survey since there are lots of friends around me are using the Airbnb and I can get lots of real user experience by taking the survey. I designed the questionnaire to ask 30 people who have used Airbnb their satisfaction and concerns about this platform. Moreover, I reviewed the online discussion of Airbnb via the platform like Reddit and App-store. I choose this method since it is easy to access. I look at the user’s rating and their reason for rating specifically. From my research, the stakeholders list lots of suggestions. Their primary motivation for tenant was to find a cheap or a big house according to their needs. Their goal is gaining benefits through the platform. The values they want to gain is a positive cycle for both the renters and tenants. However, the design did not fit their primary motivations, goals, and values. The researched reported many problems: the filter cannot help to find a good house effectively, people cannot comment with videos or pictures, and there are language barriers that may confuse the guests. Indirect Stakeholders: The indirect stakeholders would be the neighborhoods of those renters. They are the indirect stakeholders since the majority of houses that used for Airbnb are private houses. Unlike the hotel, majority of the private living will have a group of neighbors. The design of inaccurate map would make the tenant to knock on neighbor house which disturb their lives. Design Critique : The overall user’s experience and their attitude on the interaction design is good according to the survey and online discussion. And we can see people with various abilities are using Airbnb. However, the platform still contains some problems related to the use’s interfaces and interaction design. To be specific, the filter function cannot help the stakeholders(tenant) to find a ideal house effectively. According to the UI interfaces design principles, it fails to achieve the function of clarity. Moreover, after we selected the place and date in the primary page. The next interfaces that pop up will cause confusions for people with its poor design in visibility and feedback. Problem 1 Label: The first problem is related to the product filter. The design page fails certain categories of UI design principles. One primary principle of UI design is making users comfortable to interact with the design. As the picture shown, the advertisement that listed at the top of page will make the tenant feel uncomfortable. Also, the primary motivation for the tenant is to find a house according to their own need and interests. The filter recommended lots of assumed options for guests and people need to scroll down almost three pages to find some crucial factors that the price. The design is unnecessary and waste people’s time. Another principle for UI design is to reduce the cognitive loads for those stakeholders. The designer should reduce the actions required for achieving the tenant’s goal and extract the most useful information on one page. However, there are too-much information on the filter page and the users need to click lots of times to find a suitable place. Moreover, there is also an interaction design problem. The feedback for the price range is low. The tenant cannot get a good view and feedback about the price they selected through the faded region. Problem 2 Label: The second problem is on the interfaces that displayed house information after the stakeholders clicked the destination and data for travel. According to the UI design principle, the page fails to create an interface that palace users in control. Since when we entered a foreign destination, the house information will translate to the local language and there is no place for translation. For tenant that lived in another country, they will feel confuse about the overall page. They did not what the meaning of those words. And the visibility of the bottom filter is low so some people will ignore that function and the only thing they can get is the picture and price. However, the large portion of the image did not indicate so much useful information. People need to click inside to see the detail information which lead to the cognitive reload. Lastly, the page provides some misleading information. The price showed on the page is not the real price for the house. The renter often adds some extra fees, and the tenant would only know until they reached the final payment page. Redesign Proposal: For the redesigned model, I tried to fix the second problem that stated above. To begin with, the original visibility for filter is poor. The redesign added color with clear word hint for the stakeholders to see the function and select a better house according to their own needs. Also, the redesign model helps to create an interface that easy for people to navigate according to the UI design principle. For the language barrier issue, people can use the translation bottom. Besides, the redesign model put three house information on one page. That saves the stakeholder’s time and also helps them to make compare. The stars make the user directly to see others attitude towards the house on the first page which reduce the cognitive load. For the misleading information price, the new model corrects the price into the average price for the final payment each tenant made before. There are still some limitations with this new design. The first page still did not provide efficient information for tenant to choose a good house. One possible solution could be introducing a sorting bottom that can help to sort the house from the highest price to lowest price, etc. Otherwise, there could be some variation of my design idea. The stars can be transformed into the percentage of user satisfaction. Another variation could be changing the three pictures per page into two pictures per page and add more information about the house. Idea 1 - Redesign of Issue: As we can see on the graph, the redesign of the models involved some changes. The new model includes increasing visibility for the function “filter”, the new translation button, and the stars. Also, the new model put more pictures of houses per page and fix the issue of price. The change of filter is based on the principles of interaction design. Based on Don Norman’s idea, “the more visible the element is, the more likely users will know about them and use them”. Filter is a powerful function that can help people to find an ideal house based on their needs. All other change is based on the principles of UI design, all those changes are devoted to make a user-based interfaces that easy and comfortable to navigate. References: Airbnb (n.d.).

Logistic Regression model measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logit/sigmoid function. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression does not try to predict the value of a numeric variable given a set of inputs. Instead, the output is a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class. With the help of the logistic regression model, in this paper, we will create a program to predict the admission decision for U.S. graduate school of Chinese applicant. Input And Output Data Information: Data Processing: When we collect data, outliers may appear. Unlike support vector machine (SVM), Logistic Regression result will be heavily impacted by the outliers (as all data points contribute). If any independent variable in the regression model involves the wrong data, the probability can change hugely. For example, we dropped all GRE total score lower than 250 and Verbal score lower than 120 since they are unlikely to happen in reality and probably out of data entry error Outlier Detection &amp; Processing: Null/Missing Value Imputi Turning Categorical Variables into Numerical Value/One-hot Encod Dealing with Specific Issues in the Datas Materials and Methodology: Libraries like pandas, numpy and pyplot are quite standard python data processing/plottinglibraries that we use for basic data manipulation. Additionally, for this model, we importedthe sklearn library, which is a powerful package that contains our main algorithm of logisticregression. Also, packages like preprocessing and metrics in sklearn can help us preprocessdata and evaluate the performance of the model. For instance, the confusion matrix and itsderived metrics would be used to visualize and evaluate the model performance.

Goals after college. Learning skills. Writing My decision to study informatics derives from my ambition to serve human beings through technology, but coming to that decision was a process of exploration. I was first exposed to contents related to informatics in My senior year in high school. In the beginning of Covid-19 in 2020, all of us was panic due to lack of information about the virus. I searched all news and media to put the pieces together and caught the sight of whole puzzle. That was when I realized the importance of information. An efficient information system could help me turn information into actionable knowledge. Therefore, I have a strong intent to develop solutions to the world's information challenges for myself and the communities. This is my first love into informatics. After that, in the university, I have a deeper understanding of informatics. As a member of Chinese students who account for the vast majority of American international students, I’m much better able to realize that international students are facing many serious social, physical and spiritual problems. Especially during the pandemic period, many students can only take online classes, so time equation, lacking of communication with teachers and other questions cause emotional problems and academic pressure. In communicating with classmates, I found that many are under this kind of pressure silently, some even suspend or drop out, including myself. Furthermore, I found that not only Chinese students, but students from other countries also face the same psychological problems. Thus, I had the idea of designing an app to help solve the psychological problems of students. I would like to design a platform to help this special group in our community. By using machine learning methods, I could collect data，provide them information from the school, different solutions for their concerns and match different friends or mentors to help them. So here comes Mental Bridge. Our team for Info200 build the simple framework of the app together. But that was not enough, I would like to make the platform and help our international community in real world. Through three semesters' university life, I am more determined in learning informatics. The past learning experience has given me enough confidence and ability to deal with future tasks. I took a glimpse of the whole information world though Info200. I learned fundamental skills of manipulating data, machine learning and making simple regression in Info180. By using right ways to analyze data through the models in this world which has tons of information, I could push right news and right people to help my Mental Bridge users. Therefore, interest and reality motivated me to make the determination to study informatics. In my opinion, diversified courses in major informatics will make me be able to learn foundational skills and practical technology in information technology, also provide me with an interdisciplinary perspective to close the gap between technology and human needs by translating users’ requirements into technological solutions. The course Data Reasoning in a Digital World can teach me analyze the authenticity of information sources, on the basis of true information. The course Foundational Skills for Data Science can teach me how to analyze and use data through programming. While Databases and Data Modeling introduces the relevant knowledge of the database system, and links data modeling decisions to social justice outcomes. What’s more, my serious learning attitude and hardworking spirit will also help me to my future study of informatics. I believe that after learning more knowledge, I can continuously optimize and develop Mental Bridge, so that it can collect students’ psychological problems and provide suitable solutions. In other words, I want to finally create a bridge connecting students and counselors to solve the current situation when seeking help. And through my study in Informatics, I could make the program more accurate and eliminate the bias of misunderstanding users' needs in the progress of matching right solutions for every single student who needs help not only Chinese students. We are living in a era of major technological advances and information exploration. I will dedicate myself in studying how to use these information to improve our lives and make our community better. Through informatics major, I will explore the methods of change our community or even our world. all right reserved/any form of plagiarism is not allowed ","link":"https://irisdin.github.io/post/info/"},{"title":"About","content":"🏠 About the site This is a personal website that generate my work, thought and project. * remember to click to read the full content 👨‍💻 About me ISFJ-A A travel enthusiast😀 From Ningbo China➡️Seattle US University of washington informatics 24' / and I am focused on the concentration of data science and human computer interaction :) 📬 contact information Email address: irisding20020213@outlook.com follow me on: instagram: @iris_oovo feel free to contatct me if you have any questions.
