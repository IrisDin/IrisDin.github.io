        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About the Product:</p>
<p>Airbnb is a platform that people can rent their own houses to others. And guests can find the commendations like their own house. A lot of people choose Airbnb since it is normally cheaper than a hotel room and there are lots of options for choosing. People can also earn extra money by renting the house out. The platform gets profits by charging the commission from the costumer’s booking. Currently, people can access Airbnb via its website and mobile app.</p>
<p>Stakeholder Research:</p>
<p>Direct Stakeholders:</p>
<p>The people who booked their house would be the direct stakeholder group for this design. In definition, stakeholders are people who have an interest in the company’s affairs. The tenant wants to find a comfortable place to stay or for other purposes. As a result, this group would be the direct stakeholder. In order to make analysis deeply, I used the research method like surveys and review of online discuss. I choose to survey since there are lots of friends around me are using the Airbnb and I can get lots of real user experience by taking the survey. I designed the questionnaire to ask 30 people who have used Airbnb their satisfaction and concerns about this platform. Moreover, I reviewed the online discussion of Airbnb via the platform like Reddit and App-store. I choose this method since it is easy to access. I look at the user’s rating and their reason for rating specifically. From my research, the stakeholders list lots of suggestions. Their primary motivation for tenant was to find a cheap or a big house according to their needs. Their goal is gaining benefits through the platform. The values they want to gain is a positive cycle for both the renters and tenants. However, the design did not fit their primary motivations, goals, and values. The researched reported many problems: the filter cannot help to find a good house effectively, people cannot comment with videos or pictures, and there are language barriers that may confuse the guests.</p>
<p>Indirect Stakeholders:</p>
<p>The indirect stakeholders would be the neighborhoods of those renters. They are the indirect stakeholders since the majority of houses that used for Airbnb are private houses. Unlike the hotel, majority of the private living will have a group of neighbors. The design of inaccurate map would make the tenant to knock on neighbor house which disturb their lives.</p>
<p>Design Critique :<br>
The overall user’s experience and their attitude on the interaction design is good according to the survey and online discussion. And we can see people with various abilities are using Airbnb. However, the platform still contains some problems related to the use’s interfaces and interaction design. To be specific, the filter function cannot help the stakeholders(tenant) to find a ideal house effectively. According to the UI interfaces design principles, it fails to achieve the function of clarity. Moreover, after we selected the place and date in the primary page. The next interfaces that pop up will cause confusions for people with its poor design in visibility and feedback.</p>
<p>Problem 1 Label:<br>
The first problem is related to the product filter. The design page fails certain categories of UI design principles. One primary principle of UI design is making users comfortable to interact with the design. As the picture shown, the advertisement that listed at the top of page will make the tenant feel uncomfortable. Also, the primary motivation for the tenant is to find a house according to their own need and interests. The filter recommended lots of assumed options for guests and people need to scroll down almost three pages to find some crucial factors that the price. The design is unnecessary and waste people’s time. Another principle for UI design is to reduce the cognitive loads for those stakeholders. The designer should reduce the actions required for achieving the tenant’s goal and extract the most useful information on one page. However, there are too-much information on the filter page and the users need to click lots of times to find a suitable place. Moreover, there is also an interaction design problem. The feedback for the price range is low. The tenant cannot get a good view and feedback about the price they selected through the faded region.<br>

<p>Problem 2 Label<br>
The second problem is on the interfaces that displayed house information after the stakeholders clicked the destination and data for travel. According to the UI design principle, the page fails to create an interface that palace users in control. Since when we entered a foreign destination, the house information will translate to the local language and there is no place for translation. For tenant that lived in another country, they will feel confuse about the overall page. They did not what the meaning of those words. And the visibility of the bottom filter is low so some people will ignore that function and the only thing they can get is the picture and price. However, the large portion of the image did not indicate so much useful information. People need to click inside to see the detail information which lead to the cognitive reload. Lastly, the page provides some misleading information. The price showed on the page is not the real price for the house. The renter often adds some extra fees, and the tenant would only know until they reached the final payment page.<br>
<img src="https://irisdin.github.io//post-images/1639342109574.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></p>
<p>Redesign Proposal:</p>
<p>For the redesigned model, I tried to fix the second problem that stated above. To begin with, the original visibility for filter is poor. The redesign added color with clear word hint for the stakeholders to see the function and select a better house according to their own needs. Also, the redesign model helps to create an interface that easy for people to navigate according to the UI design principle. For the language barrier issue, people can use the translation bottom. Besides, the redesign model put three house information on one page. That saves the stakeholder’s time and also helps them to make compare. The stars make the user directly to see others attitude towards the house on the first page which reduce the cognitive load. For the misleading information price, the new model corrects the price into the average price for the final payment each tenant made before. There are still some limitations with this new design. The first page still did not provide efficient information for tenant to choose a good house. One possible solution could be introducing a sorting bottom that can help to sort the house from the highest price to lowest price, etc. Otherwise, there could be some variation of my design idea. The stars can be transformed into the percentage of user satisfaction. Another variation could be changing the three pictures per page into two pictures per page and add more information about the house.</p>
<p>Idea 1 - Redesign of Issue:</p>
<p>As we can see on the graph, the redesign of the models involved some changes. The new model includes increasing visibility for the function “filter”, the new translation button, and the stars. Also, the new model put more pictures of houses per page and fix the issue of price. The change of filter is based on the principles of interaction design. Based on Don Norman’s idea, “the more visible the element is, the more likely users will know about them and use them”. Filter is a powerful function that can help people to find an ideal house based on their needs. All other change is based on the principles of UI design, all those changes are devoted to make a user-based interfaces that easy and comfortable to navigate.<br>
