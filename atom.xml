        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Abstract:<br>
Logistic Regression is a type of classification algorithm involving a linear discriminant. Logistic Regression model measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logit/sigmoid function. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression does not try to predict the value of a numeric variable given a set of inputs. Instead, the output is a probability that the given input point belongs to a certain class. With the help of the logistic regression model, in this paper, we will create a program to predict the admission decision for U.S. graduate school of Chinese applicant.</p>

<p><strong>Data Processing:</strong><br>
When we collect data, outliers may appear. Unlike support vector machine (SVM), Logistic Regression result will be heavily impacted by the outliers (as all data points contribute). If any independent variable in the regression model involves the wrong data, the probability can change hugely. For example, we dropped all GRE total score lower than 250 and Verbal score lower than 120 since they are unlikely to happen in reality and probably out of data entry error</p>
